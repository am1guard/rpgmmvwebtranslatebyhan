After opening the program, you will see this screen.

Now I want you to look at how many letters the game has by typing game. that it is possible to combine this automatically. Since the limit is 50 in my game, I enter 50 here. If you do not set this, the game texts will overflow the textbox.

Then we press the export to html button and it takes us to the default browser.

I want to use Edge from here and I recommend Edge to all of you. The translation is very good and compatible with the program.

right-click anywhere on the page and press turn page

when this happens we use ctrl + mousescrolldown at the same time to set the text on the page to the farthest side. then we press pagedown at 3 second intervals until we get to the end.
when we get to the end we press ctrl + copy all the translated text and paste it into certain parts of the program.
